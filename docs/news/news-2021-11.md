## Breaking Changes
MODULE OUTPUTS CHANGED
Before to get the first subnet it would be necessary to use:
```
subnet_ids                       = [module.network[0].private_subnet_ids[0][0]]
```
And now, this will suffice:
```
subnet_ids                       = [module.network[0].private_subnet_ids[0]]
```
