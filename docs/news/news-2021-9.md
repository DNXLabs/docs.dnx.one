## terraform-aws-ecs - 5.6.0
ENHANCEMENTS
- Control EFS creation unconditionally from Fargate

NOTES
⚠️ There's a possible drift caused by this update:

If you use `fargate_only: true` before this update, it would *not* create EFS.
After this update, it will create EFS.

So if you do not require EFS, you need to pass `create_efs: false` to disable it.
