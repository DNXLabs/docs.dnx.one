* Obs. Do not remove users from the list, there's a revoking process described below.

## Download a new user certificate.

When a user is added, OpenVPN Server creates a ".ovpn" and ".mfa" files to an S3 bucket in the Shared-Service account. These files need to be downloaded and sent to the user to connect to the VPN.

To download this file:

1. Access AWS Console → Shared Account
2. S3
3. Find a bucket called openvpn-shared-services-<random number>

 * Open the bucket
 * Download both files (.ovpn and .mfa) with your username.

**Important.** That files should not be shared between users. Sharing these files will cause connection interruptions as one user can maintain only one connection at a time.


## Configure and connect (MAC OS)
 * Download and install OpenVPN Tunnelblick client.

 https://tunnelblick.net/release/Tunnelblick_3.8.4a_build_5601.dmg

 * Click on TunnelBlick icon in the menu bar at the top and select 'VPN Details' option.

1. On the “user name” field, type exactly your ".ovpn" file name, except by the file extension. E.g: if you have a file called “dnx-devop1.ovpn", use “dnx-devop1” as username.
2. Open the ".mfa" file and copy the MFA URL.
3. Paste the URL in your favourite Web Browser to see the QR code.
4. Use your favorite MFA tool such as Google Authenticator, scan the QR Code and get the password.
